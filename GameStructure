have an a-l 1-12 coordinate system with pieces moving as they normally do in 2 player chess
checkmate is instead delivered by taking the king in this version instead of giving check to a player with them having no available moves
castling even if the kings path is interrupted by a check attack is now allowed as this version also allows a player to put themselves in check as it allows for teamplay
promotion works as normal
en passant works as normal
50 pawn rule works as normal
instead of draw by repetition, we will instead have a draw button where the players can agree on a draw, only a draw if all 3 players agree to it, bots automatically accept
